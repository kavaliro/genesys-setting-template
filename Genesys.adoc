== Purpose

This is a template for creating Genesys settings using Asciidoc. It's fancy enough to impress the natives, easy enough that you can _sic the natives on it,_ and in a format that Github understands (which makes it a breeze to share with the world.)

.Table Formatting

I didn't see any center justified entries in the Core Book. But: Asciidoc _does_ support that.
