== Purpose

This is a template for creating Genesys settings using Asciidoc. It's fancy enough to impress the natives, easy enough that you can _sic the natives on it,_ and in a format that Github understands (which makes it a breeze to share with the world.)


== Dice

I have a dicey proposition. *Formidable({difficulty}{difficulty}{difficulty}{difficulty}{difficulty})*

Don't {threat}{threat} me, _pal!_

.Table Formatting
****
I didn't see any center justified entries in the Core Book. But: Asciidoc _does_ support that.
